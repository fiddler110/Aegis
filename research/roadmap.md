# Aegis Capability Roadmap

**Last updated:** 2026-07-21

This document tracks only **open** work and what's next. For shipped-feature history and full
design rationale, see [releases.md](releases.md). Every open item is a `### P<n>.<m>` heading
with a `Priority:` line in its body — `scripts/roadmap-status.sh` parses exactly that shape, so
keep it when adding items.

---

## Status

**Open items:** 1 actionable-blocked + 1 parked.

- **P38.1** (Tier 2) — non-orchestrated, single-context threat-model build. The build path is shipped
  and its mechanism is live-confirmed (qwen3:14b scaffolds all seven files in one context). What remains
  is a **live conformance re-test on a stronger local model**: qwen3:14b does not reach a verify-clean
  suite, and the doctor-recommended `qwen3.6:35b-a3b` MoE is not on disk. Genuinely environment-gated —
  re-run once a capable-enough model is installed. See the item below.
- **P25.9** (Tier 4) — per-session scoping of the remaining daemon-singleton services (`lsp.Manager`).
  Parked pending demand; do not build speculatively.

A handful of unfiled **leads** (condensed under Tier 2/Tier 3 below) capture mechanical follow-ups worth
their own item when a concrete need appears.

---

## Tiering Criteria

**Tier 1** = real, currently-exploitable security/robustness gaps, small effort, no dependency.  
**Tier 2** = cheap, no-dependency wins — user-facing polish or small self-contained hardening.  
**Tier 3** = real value but larger or sequence-dependent (blocks or is blocked by other work).  
**Tier 4** = low urgency, no trigger, or explicitly parked pending demand — do not build speculatively.

## Open Work — Tier 1

**Status:** 0 open.

## Open Work — Tier 2

**Status:** 1 open — **P38.1** (environment-gated on a stronger local model).

### P38.1 — Non-orchestrated, single-context threat-model build (primary path for local models)

The threat-modeling skill's primary build is a single-context linear build the driving model runs itself —
no sub-agents, no `agent`-tool orchestration. Context stays bounded by levers that already exist (SKILL.md
§4): `recon.py`'s ~11KB digest, P36.2 pruning of spent write/read payloads, incremental section-at-a-time
writes, and the deterministic P37 scripts. `scaffold.py` (P38.4) pre-writes all seven files from the
skeletons with real structure + a unique `<!-- PENDING: <section> -->` marker per fillable section, so the
model fills sections instead of authoring structure.

**Mechanism: live-confirmed.** In the 2026-07-21 re-test (qwen3:14b vs AiGateway, `aegis chat --skill
threat-modeling` drive-to-completion) the model ran `recon.py` → `scaffold.py` and wrote all seven files in
one context with no orchestration mis-route — the P36.3-era failure that killed every prior run is gone.

**Conformance: still unmet on qwen3:14b.** The 14B model's weakness has moved from "authoring structure"
(P38.4 fixed that) to "incrementally filling it via `edit_file`": it scaffolds but can't drive the fill to a
verify-clean suite. The two *actionable* findings from that re-test — think-mode fabrication and the
identical-marker `replace_all` footgun — were split out and **shipped** as P38.6 and P38.7 (see
[releases.md](releases.md#latest-changes)). What's left is not code: no stronger local model was on disk
(`qwen3.6:35b-a3b` not installed) to exercise the "or a stronger local" arm.

P36.2 (pruning that keeps a single-context linear build inside the window) is the load-bearing mechanism
here and is **partially confirmed live** (a 33-call run held inside ~44K input tokens with no overflow); its
definitive confirmation rides on a scaffolded, verify-clean re-test measured through P38.3's per-turn usage
telemetry.

Priority: Tier 2 — the re-test has been executed and the mechanism is live-confirmed; the verify-clean goal
is unmet on the only capable-enough on-disk model. What remains is genuinely environment-gated: **re-run on
a stronger local model** (`qwen3.6:35b-a3b` or similar, once installed). Not Tier 1 because this is a
live-run verification, not independent build work — the whole build path exists and is confirmed to run.

**Lead (not yet filed):** the "accurate refusal, error-shaped" exit-code question for the SCA/secrets
scanners. P34.6 checked the *language*-targeted tools; nothing has swept the SCA/secrets tools for non-zero
exits that mean "nothing to do" rather than "I broke". No `### P<n>.<m>` heading yet.

---

## Open Work — Tier 3

**Status:** 0 filed. Open leads only (each worth its own item when a concrete need appears):

**Lead — doc-inconsistency (surfaced building the P37 scripts):**
(a) **threat-ID form** — `references/skeletons/skeleton-stride.md` writes threat IDs as bare sequential
`T1`/`T2`, but `output-formats.md`'s coverage / Related-Threats examples use composite `T04.S` form; the
P37 scripts match both, but the docs should settle on one canonical form.
(b) **inventory YAML style** — `skeleton-inventory.md`'s example is block-style while directive #13 says
list entries are one-line, and `inventory.py` emits one-line flow mappings; the skeleton example should
match what the generator produces. Both cosmetic doc drift, not code bugs.

**Lead — `recon.py` (P37.1) depth follow-ups**, left out of v1 deliberately:
(a) **data-flow edge inference** — seed the DFD's `DF##` flows from import graphs / client instantiations
so phase 2 starts from real edges;
(b) **config-default resolution** — parse the actual bind-address default from the config struct /
`config.yaml` to settle the deployment class deterministically (and downgrade `EXPOSE`/`0.0.0.0` to
`internal-network` when the k8s `Service` is `NodePort`/`ClusterIP` with no TLS terminator, rather than
over-flagging `internet-facing`);
(c) **richer symbol extraction** — functions/methods and route→handler maps, optionally via
`ctags`/tree-sitter when on PATH;
(d) **target-commit in the sidecar** — let `inventory.py` take an optional `--target-dir`/`--repo` (or read
the commit from `0-assessment.md`) so a run directory kept outside the target repo still records the
analyzed code's commit.

---

## Open Work — Tier 4

### P25.9 — per-session scoping of `lsp.Manager` (remaining daemon singleton)

Five of the six daemon-singleton services were per-session-scoped when P25.9 first shipped; `lsp.Manager`
was deliberately left as a shared singleton — its per-session resource-growth tradeoff was judged worse
than the isolation gap. Parked pending a concrete multi-tenant need.

Priority: Tier 4 — no trigger, explicitly parked. Do not build speculatively.
